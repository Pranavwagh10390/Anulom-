### Suggested Improvements for Yale Art Website

- Add modern responsive design (currently feels outdated)
- Simplify menu navigation
- Improve accessibility (color contrast, alt texts)
- Add interactive admission steps for students
- Improve mobile responsiveness

Reason: Current layout feels artistic but confusing for first-time users.
